# infinite-dogs-jobox
## My stab at the coding challenge for jobox.aiâ€”an infinite scroll of dog pictures.

### For this coding challenge, my task was to use react to create an infinite scroll interface where the user could search through random or filtered dog pictures provided by the dog.ceo API. 

### The program had to: 
  1. avoid displaying duplicates 
  2. filter images by breed 
  3. be mobile responsive.
